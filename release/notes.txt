WELCOME TO EPANET 2.2
=====================
EPANET is a program for analyzing the hydraulic and water quality behavior of pressurized
pipe networks. It was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPANET 2.2 is open souce software that may be freely
copied and distributed. A complete Users Manual as well as full source code and other updates
can be accessed from https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet or from https://github.com/USEPA/EPANET2.2.

FILES INSTALLED BY THE SETUP PROGRAM
====================================
The setup program for EPANET 2.2 places the following files into your EPANET 2.2 installation
directory:
  epanet2w.exe  -- the Windows version of EPANET 2.2
  runepanet.exe -- the DOS command line version of EPANET 2.2
  epanet2.dll   -- the numerical engine used by both epanet2w and runepanet
  epanet2.chm   -- the EPANET 2.2 Help file
  tutorial.chm  -- the on-line tutorial
  notes.txt     -- this file

EXAMPLE NETWORKS
================
EPANET 2.2 also comes with four example pipe networks to help one become familiar with the
program. They are placed in a sub-folder named "EPANET Projects\Examples" in your Documents
folder and consist of the following files:

  net1.net     -- a simple pipe network modeling chlorine decay
  net2.net     -- an example of a tracer study utilizing calibration data
  net2-FL.dat  -- calibration data used with net2.net
  net3.net     -- a larger network model illustrating source tracing
  net4.net     -- a simple pipe network illustrating pressure driven analysis (steady state)

When running any of these networks we recommend that you view the Project Summary first
(select Project >> Summary from the main menu) to read any background notes about the
example.

NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2.2
===========================
1. Pressure-dependent demands.
2. More robust convergence criteria.
3. Faster solution times for single period analyses.
4. Improved handling of near-zero flows.
5. Allowing tanks to overflow when full.
6. Improved water quality mass balances.
7. A comprehensive set of API functions that allows:
   a. the engine to be run in a thread-safe manner
   b. network elements to be created and deleted in code
   c. all network data to be retrieved and modified in code.
